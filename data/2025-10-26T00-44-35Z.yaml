  description: 'MiniMax-M2 is a compact, high-efficiency large language model optimized
    for end-to-end coding and agentic workflows. With 10 billion activated parameters
    (230 billion total), it delivers near-frontier intelligence across general reasoning,
    tool use, and multi-step task execution while maintaining low latency and deployment
    efficiency.


    The model excels in code generation, multi-file editing, compile-run-fix loops,
    and test-validated repair, showing strong results on SWE-Bench Verified, Multi-SWE-Bench,
    and Terminal-Bench. It also performs competitively in agentic evaluations such
    as BrowseComp and GAIA, effectively handling long-horizon planning, retrieval,
    and recovery from execution errors.


    Benchmarked by [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/minimax-m2),
    MiniMax-M2 ranks among the top open-source models for composite intelligence,
    spanning mathematics, science, and instruction-following. Its small activation
    footprint enables fast inference, high concurrency, and improved unit economics,
    making it well-suited for large-scale agents, developer assistants, and reasoning-driven
    applications that require responsiveness and cost efficiency.'

    reasoning/chat model derived from Meta’s Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a 128K context.
    It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math,
    code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware
    Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
    for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven
    Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies
    FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU
    (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.


    In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95),
    the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4,

    = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency
    (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning
    on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable
    for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced
    accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.

    compared to prior models.


    The model includes a fully automated synthetic data pipeline for scalable pre-training,
    fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. It uses large-scale continual pre-training
    on diverse agentic data to boost reasoning and stay fresh. It also features end-to-end
    on-policy RL with a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization, including token-level
    gradients and negative sample filtering for stable training. The model supports
    ReAct for core ability checks and an IterResearch-based ''Heavy'' mode for max
    performance through test-time scaling. It''s ideal for advanced research agents,
    tool use, and heavy inference workflows.'

    Qwen3-Next line that outputs structured “thinking” traces by default. It’s designed
    for hard multi-step problems; math proofs, code synthesis/debugging, logic, and
    agentic planning, and reports strong results across knowledge, reasoning, coding,
    alignment, and multilingual evaluations. Compared with prior Qwen3 variants, it
    emphasizes stability under long chains of thought and efficient scaling during
    inference, and it is tuned to follow complex instructions while reducing repetitive
    or off-task behavior.


    The model is suitable for agent frameworks and tool use (function calling), retrieval-heavy
    workflows, and standardized benchmarking where step-by-step solutions are required.
    It supports long, detailed completions and leverages throughput-oriented techniques
    (e.g., multi-token prediction) for faster generation. Note that it operates in

    benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories
    while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general

  description: Venice Uncensored Dolphin Mistral 24B Venice Edition is a fine-tuned
    variant of Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501, developed by dphn.ai in collaboration
    with Venice.ai. This model is designed as an “uncensored” instruct-tuned LLM,
    preserving user control over alignment, system prompts, and behavior. Intended
    for advanced and unrestricted use cases, Venice Uncensored emphasizes steerability
    and transparent behavior, removing default safety and alignment layers typically
    found in mainstream assistant models.

  description: Kimi-Dev-72B is an open-source large language model fine-tuned for
    software engineering and issue resolution tasks. Based on Qwen2.5-72B, it is optimized
    using large-scale reinforcement learning that applies code patches in real repositories
    and validates them via full test suite execution—rewarding only correct, robust
    completions. The model achieves 60.4% on SWE-bench Verified, setting a new benchmark
    among open-source models for software bug fixing and code reasoning.

    \ the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are\
    \ a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to\

    This model supports the `reasoning_effort` parameter, which can be set to "high",

    OpenRouter also offers the model slug `openai/o3-mini-high` to default the parameter
    to "high".


    The model features three adjustable reasoning effort levels and supports key developer
    capabilities including function calling, structured outputs, and streaming, though
    it does not include vision processing capabilities.


    The model demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor, with expert
    testers preferring its responses 56% of the time and noting a 39% reduction in
    major errors on complex questions. With medium reasoning effort settings, o3-mini
    matches the performance of the larger o1 model on challenging reasoning evaluations
    like AIME and GPQA, while maintaining lower latency and cost.'

    supporting both text and image inputs with text outputs.


    As their most advanced small model, it is many multiples more affordable than
    other recent frontier models, and more than 60% cheaper than [GPT-3.5 Turbo](/models/openai/gpt-3.5-turbo).
    It maintains SOTA intelligence, while being significantly more cost-effective.


    GPT-4o mini achieves an 82% score on MMLU and presently ranks higher than GPT-4
