      "description": "Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview is Google’s frontier reasoning model, delivering enhanced software engineering performance, improved agentic reliability, and more efficient token usage across complex workflows. Building on the multimodal foundation of the Gemini 3 series, it combines high-precision reasoning across text, image, video, audio, and code with a 1M-token context window. Reasoning Details must be preserved when using multi-turn tool calling, see our docs here: https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#preserving-reasoning. The 3.1 update introduces measurable gains in SWE benchmarks and real-world coding environments, along with stronger autonomous task execution in structured domains such as finance and spreadsheet-based workflows.\n\nDesigned for advanced development and agentic systems, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview improves long-horizon stability and tool orchestration while increasing token efficiency. It introduces a new medium thinking level to better balance cost, speed, and performance. The model excels in agentic coding, structured planning, multimodal analysis, and workflow automation, making it well-suited for autonomous agents, financial modeling, spreadsheet automation, and high-context enterprise tasks.",

It is a 671 B-parameter mixture-of-experts text-generation model assembled from DeepSeek-AI’s R1-0528, R1, and V3-0324 checkpoints with an Assembly-of-Experts merge. The tri-parent design yields strong reasoning performance while running roughly 20 % faster than the original R1 and more than 2× faster than R1-0528 under vLLM, giving a favorable cost-to-intelligence trade-off. The checkpoint supports contexts up to 60 k tokens in standard use (tested to ~130 k) and maintains consistent <think> token behaviour, making it suitable for long-context analysis, dialogue and other open-ended generation tasks.",

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens",
