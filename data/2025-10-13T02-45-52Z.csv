It represents the first flagship non-thinking model in the Ling 2.0 series, built around a sparse-activation architecture with roughly 50 billion active parameters per token. The model supports up to 128 K tokens of context and emphasizes efficient reasoning through an “Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought (Evo-CoT)” training strategy.

Pre-trained on more than 20 trillion reasoning-dense tokens, Ling-1T achieves strong results across code generation, mathematics, and logical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency. It employs FP8 mixed-precision training, MoE routing with QK normalization, and MTP layers for compositional reasoning stability. The model also introduces LPO (Linguistics-unit Policy Optimization) for post-training alignment, enhancing sentence-level semantic control.

Ling-1T can perform complex text generation, multilingual reasoning, and front-end code synthesis with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics."

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.

In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53.

Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.

Unlike traditional models that generate answers immediately, Grok 3 Mini thinks before responding. It’s ideal for reasoning-heavy tasks that don’t demand extensive domain knowledge, and shines in math-specific and quantitative use cases, such as solving challenging puzzles or math problems.

Transparent ""thinking"" traces accessible. Defaults to low reasoning, can boost with setting `reasoning: { effort: ""high"" }`

Note: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add `provider: { sort: throughput}`, to sort by throughput instead.
