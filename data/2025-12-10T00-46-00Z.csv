- Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches)
- Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.
- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase.
